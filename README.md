Smart FIR Assist

📌 Project Overview

Project Name: Smart FIR Assist
Team Name: InnovX
Hackathon: JNTU-GV Hackathon
College: NRI Institute of Technology
City: Vijayawada
Domain: AI for Good / LegalTech

Smart FIR Assist is an AI-powered system designed to modernize and streamline the First Information Report (FIR) filing process. The existing FIR system is largely manual, time-consuming, and dependent on individual police officers’ experience.

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Automation to convert unstructured citizen complaints into structured, legally accurate FIR drafts aligned with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).

🚨 Problem Statement:

The traditional FIR filing process faces multiple challenges:
Complaints are often emotional and unstructured
Manual interpretation of incidents by officers
Difficulty in identifying correct BNS sections
Time-consuming FIR drafting
High workload on police officers
Delays, errors, and lack of standardization
Poor integration of evidence and record tracking
Limited transparency and efficiency

💡 Proposed Solution:

An AI-powered automated FIR assistance platform that:
Accepts citizen complaints in natural language
Extracts critical information such as:
Date and time of incident
Location
Sequence of events
People involved
Recommends relevant BNS sections
Auto-generates a standardized FIR draft
Assists police officers in verification and approval
Maintains digital records and evidence tracking

⚙️ Key Features:

🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) for complaint understanding
⚖️ BNS Section Recommendation Engine
📝 Automated FIR Draft Generation
🗂️ Structured Data Extraction
🧾 Evidence Upload & Management
🔍 Jurisdiction Identification
⏱️ Reduced FIR Registration Time
🔐 Secure & Transparent Record Handling

🏗️ System Architecture (High Level):

1. Citizen submits complaint (text/voice)
2. AI processes and structures the complaint
3. System extracts key incident details
4. Relevant BNS sections are suggested
5. FIR draft is generated automatically
6. Police officer reviews, edits, and approves
7. FIR is officially registered and stored


🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React
Backend: Python / Node.js
